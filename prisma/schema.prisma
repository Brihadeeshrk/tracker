  // By default, when we declare a column as String in mysql, it will be translated to a column with varchar(191), as in, a string with 191chara. but if we want to override this char count, we can use the following
  title       String   @db.VarChar(255)
  // when you know the text to be stored is going to be lengthy, we can just use db.Text
  description String   @db.Text

  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt

// convention is to use caps and eacg value is to be in a separate line
// note that, enums are supported in mysql, but if youre going to use another provider, make sure to check if that provider supports enums
